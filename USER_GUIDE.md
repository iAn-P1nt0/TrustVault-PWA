## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my data uploaded to the cloud?

No. TrustVault is **offline-first**. All data is stored locally in your browser's IndexedDB. Nothing is transmitted to any server.

### What if I lose my device?

If you have vault exports, you can import into TrustVault on a new device. Without exports, data is unrecoverable.

### Can I use TrustVault on multiple devices?

Yes, but sync is manual:
1. Export from Device A
2. Transfer `.tvault` file securely (USB, encrypted cloud)
3. Import on Device B

### How secure is TrustVault?

- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM (military-grade)
- **Hashing:** Scrypt (N=32768, memory-hard)
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 (600k iterations)
- **Audited:** OWASP Mobile Top 10 compliant
- **Open Source:** Fully transparent

### Does TrustVault work offline?

Yes! As a PWA, TrustVault works completely offline once installed. No internet required.

### What happens if I forget my master password?

Your data is **unrecoverable**. This is by design - zero-knowledge architecture means TrustVault cannot access your vault. Export backups are your only recovery option.

### Can I export to other password managers?

Currently, TrustVault uses a proprietary encrypted format. Future versions may support CSV export (unencrypted - use with caution).
