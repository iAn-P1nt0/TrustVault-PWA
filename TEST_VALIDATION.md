- Load testing
- Browser compatibility matrix

---

## Recommendations

### Before Production
1. ✅ Run full test suite
2. ✅ Verify >85% coverage
3. ⚠️ Add E2E tests with real browser
4. ⚠️ Security audit by third party
5. ⚠️ Penetration testing
6. ⚠️ Performance profiling
7. ⚠️ Cross-browser testing

### Continuous Testing
- Run tests on every commit
- Block PRs with failing tests
- Monitor coverage trends
- Update tests with new features
- Regular security audits
